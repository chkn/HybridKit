# HybridKit

Simple C# – JavaScript bridge for building hybrid iOS and Android apps.

### Here's what it does:

- Call script functions and get/set values on script objects from C# using `dynamic`
	- Marshals simple values between script and C# by value (JSON)
	- Marshals complex script objects to C# by reference
- Catch script exceptions in C#

### Here's what it doesn't do (yet):

- Call C# methods from a script within a web view.
- Attach C# event handlers to events on script objects.
- Create strongly-typed wrappers for JavaScript APIs.

# Getting Started

To start utilizing HybridKit, follow the steps below:

1. Add HybridKit to your app. [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugin.HybridKit) is the recommended way to do this.
2. Add the following references to your project:
	+ `Microsoft.CSharp`
	+ `Xamarin.Forms` (currently required, even if your project does not use it.)
	+ For Android only:
		- `Mono.Android.Export`	

HybridKit currently requires Xamarin.Forms 1.3.1 or later. If you install HybridKit through NuGet, it will install an appropriate version for you automatically. 

## Create the Web View

### Xamarin.iOS

On iOS, the HybridKit API is exposed as extension methods on `UIWebView`. Declare a new `UIWebView`, as shown in the code snippet below:

```
using UIKit;
using HybridKit;
// ...
var webView = new UIWebView ();
```

### Xamarin.Android

On Android, create an instance of `HybridKit.Android.HybridWebView`. This class extends `Android.WebKit.WebView` and will need to be configured in the same way—generally at least enabling JavaScript, as shown below:

```
using HybridKit.Android;
// ...
var webView = new HybridWebView ();
webView.Settings.JavaScriptEnabled = true;
```

### Xamarin.Forms

When using [Xamarin.Forms](http://xamarin.com/forms) on iOS or Android, create a new `HybridKit.Forms.HybridWebView`, which extends from `Xamarin.Forms.WebView`:

```
using HybridKit.Forms;

// ... On the native app:
HybridWebViewRenderer.Init ();

// ... In the shared code:
var webView = new HybridWebView ();
```

## Load some Content

You may want to load an HTML file that is bundled with your app into the web view. HybridKit makes this easier by suppling the `LoadFromBundle` extension method on **iOS and Android**:

```
webView.LoadFromBundle ("index.html");
```

For **Xamarin.Forms**, HybridKit supplies the `BundleWebViewSource` class:

```
webView.Source = new BundleWebViewSource ("index.html");
```
The path passed into both of these APIs is the bundle-relative path on iOS, or the path relative to the Assets folder for an Android project.

## Run some Script

To execute script inside the web view, call `RunScriptAsync` on the web view.

Although the name of this method ends with "Async," it may actually run synchronously depending on the threading constraints of the current platform (see **important note about threading** below). Generally, you'll want to await the `Task` returned by this method, which simulates a synchronous method call in either case:

```
await webView.RunScriptAsync (window => {
	var name = window.prompt ("What is your name?") ?? "World";
	var node = window.document.createTextNode (string.Format ("Hello {0} from C#!", name));
	window.document.body.appendChild (node);
});
```
The `window` argument to the lambda is the JavaScript global object. In the example above, the JavaScript `prompt` function is called, which displays a dialog to the user, and returns their entered text (or the string "World" if they click Cancel). It then creates a new text node and appends it to the DOM. You can see this code in action in the KitchenSink sample app.

**Important Note about Threading**

Within the script lambda passed to `RunScriptAsync`, HybridKit evaluates JavaScript synchronously. Unfortunately, different platforms have different requirements for this:

- On iOS, all calls into JavaScript must be done from the main UI thread.
- On newer versions of Android (KitKat and later), it will deadlock if a call to JavaScript is made synchronously from the main UI thread.

To accommodate these different requirements, the `RunScriptAsync` method may dispatch to a different thread to run the passed lambda. Because of this, you must be careful to properly synchronize external objects used in the lambda, and take proper care of any script objects persisted outside the scope of the lambda. Script objects may be used safely in multiple `RunScriptAsync` calls. Best practice for this is shown below:

**DO NOT do this!** – It causes an implicit `ToString` call on the current thread, which might not work:

```
dynamic foo;
await webView.RunScriptAsync (window => {
	foo = window.foo;
});
// ...
Console.WriteLine (foo);
```

**This is OK** – the `RunScriptAsync` method ensures the implicit `ToString` call happens on the correct thread:

```
dynamic foo;
await webView.RunScriptAsync (window => {
	foo = window.foo;
});
// ...
await webView.RunScriptAsync (_ => Console.WriteLine (foo));
```

# Development

This project is brand new, so expect bugs. Feedback and contributions are always welcome!

## Cloning

After cloning this repository, you'll also need to update the submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## Compiling

I've been working in Xamarin Studio on the Mac, in which you can simply open `HybridKit.sln` and hit build.

On Windows, I've heard reports of compilation issues, probably due to some C# 6 features used in the codebase. If you're on Windows, try compiling with Roslyn or the `mcs` compiler from Mono. If you get it working, let me know and I'll update this section.

## Running the Unit Tests

Run the `HybridKit.Tests.Android` or `HybridKit.Tests.iOS` projects to run the tests on Android or iOS, respectively.
